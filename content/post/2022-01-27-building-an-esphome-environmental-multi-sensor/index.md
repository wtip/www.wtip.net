Sometime early last year I replaced my SmartThings home automation hub with a [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) VM running on an Intel NUC.

Not long after that I converted my Envirosense boards ([see previous post](/blog/2020/03/envirosense-esp8266-prometheus-exporter/)) to run the [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) firmware and started scraping Prometheus metrics from Home Assistant.

There was one thing I wasn't happy about with my original design.
The PIR sensor was frequently showing false positive motion events.  
This seems to have gotten worse with the switch to the ESPHome firmware. It appears to be a known issue that these HC-SR501 modules are easily triggered by Wifi interference. 

So I decided to redesign the board and enclosure to use a better PIR sensor and also added an ambient light sensor.

I used some [Perf+ 2](https://www.crowdsupply.com/ben-wang/perf-2) wire free electronic prototyping board that I had picked up a while back. Unfortunately it looks like this is no longer available anywhere. There's a simple windows .NET based circuit design program called Perfy, that I used for the board layout.

Here's the main parts list:
- NodeMCU ESP8266
- Bosch BME280 breakout board
- Panasonic [EKMC1609111](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/panasonic-electric-works/EKMC1609111/13618562)
- Adafruit [BH1750 Light Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4681)
- 1 x 47KÎ© resistor (*used as a pull-down on the PIR breakout*)

Example ESPHome configuration below:

```
Note that you'll also need an an additional `secrets.yaml` file that has matching entries for the various `!secret` variables referenced in the above example.
